This is a text adventure I wrote that is four rooms large. 
Currently, there are only a few items, monsters,
and actual working elements actually programmed in. 
However, none of the project was hard-coded,
and can be added to with ease, 
given a minor understanding of the project layout.

--I'm keeping this for nostalgia's sake, as this is my first real project :)
